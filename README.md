## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/PRODIGY_ML_01.git


2. Navigate into the project directory:
cd PRODIGY_ML_01

3. Install dependencies:
   python customer_segmentation.py

Usage
To run the customer segmentation script, use the following command:
python customer_segmentation.py

This will execute the K-means clustering algorithm on the provided dataset (Mall_Customers.csv) and visualize the clusters.

Data Description
The dataset (Mall_Customers.csv) contains customer information including CustomerID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.

Results
The K-means clustering algorithm successfully identified distinct customer segments based on their spending behavior. Visualizations show clear clusters that can inform targeted marketing strategies.

Future Enhancements
Implement other clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN, Hierarchical clustering) for comparison.
Develop a web-based dashboard for interactive visualization of customer segments.
